# Aikya's Shakti

Aikya is a designed space settlement that orbits Ganymede and is made to hold human civilization. When designing Aikya, one primary concern was posed: How will humans adjust to life there? This brought me to develop Shakti.

"Shakti," meaning power in Sanskrit, is a mental health chatbot made to help Aikya's residents seek emotional support and guidance. Aikyans prompt Shakti and return a crafted response based on the user's needs. A simple user interface is built for high functionality.
