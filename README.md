Developed as a research project, Aikya is a space settlement that orbits Ganymede and is made to hold human civilization. When designing Aikya, one primary concern was posed: How will humans adjust to life abroad? Such sparking the development of Shakti.

"Shakti," meaning power in Sanskrit, is a digital therapist made to help Aikya's residents seek emotional support and guidance. Aikyans prompt Shakti and return a crafted response based on the user's needs. A simple user interface is built for high functionality.
